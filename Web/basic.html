  <h2>By<br>
    <sub>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
  </h2></sub>
  <hr>
   
  <p class = "lead m-2">The <b>Hound of the Baskervilles</b> is the third of the four <i>crime</i> novels
    written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes.
    Originally serialised in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April
    1902, it is set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and
    tells the story of an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a
    <i>fearsome</i>, <i> diabolical</i> hound of supernatural origin.</p>
   
   
    <p class="m-2">Sherlock Holmes and his
    companion Dr. Watson investigate the case. This was the first appearance
    of Holmes since his apparent death in "The Final Problem", and the success
    of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's eventual revival.
    One of the most famous stories ever written,in 2003, the book was listed
    as number 128 of 200 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's
    "best-loved novel". In 1999, it was listed as the top Holmes novel, with a
    perfect rating from Sherlockian scholars of 100.

  <p>
    Holmes is consulted in his Baker Street apartment by Dr. Mortimer, a
    physician now living on the fringes of Dartmoor. He gives Holmes and
    Watson an account of a centuries-old legend, in which a hell-hound
    slaughtered the <i>debauched</i> heir of the Baskerville family who had been in
    lecherous pursuit of an innocent maiden across the moor. The same hound is
    reputed to have harrowed several of the subsequent heirs to the estate.
    This ancient story might be dismissed as mere fancy, but for the fact that
    the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville recently died in very mysterious
    circumstances, apparently fleeing in terror from something which came from
    the moor. Dr. Mortimer is concerned that the new heir, Sir Henry, just
    returned from Canada, may be at risk from this supernatural beast. Holmes
    is intrigued, but being too busy to go himself, sends Dr. Watson to
    accompany Sir Henry to the ancestral home on Dartmoor and to report
    anything suspicious.
